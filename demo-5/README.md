In this example we use AWS Datasources.

We filter traffic based on AWS region

- allow all traffic from amazon ec2 services in Europe.

Filtering traffic in AWS can be done using security groups.

A security group will be created.

Incoming traffic can be filtered by protocol, IP range and port.

---

ssh uses port 22
http uses port 80

We can see the created security group in the VPC dashboard.
